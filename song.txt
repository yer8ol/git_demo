I wish everything I touch would turn to gold 
NLE, you heard me?
Baby Mexico Choppa, man, 
Top 
Shotta Baby Mexico Shotta, you heard me?
We finna talk our shit, you heard me? 
YNR (Yeah) 
Midas got a jugg, ayy (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I am a menace, keep me a rack just like tennis
I'm with the shit like I'm Dennis
I started this shit, I'ma finish
Niggas be hatin', tryna blemish my image
Who want the smoke? .223 came with the scope
Extended clip long as a rope
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
I knew that boy was a ho
Pull up with the gang, you know that we bangin'
What is your set, nigga? What is you claimin'?
I am a beast, you cannot tame it
Don't point a finger, this shit can get dangerous
These niggas hatin', these niggas plottin'
Ooh, he got money, I'm runnin' his wallet
You say you a killer, lil' nigga, stop it
In a shootout, your gun was droppin'
So many bullets, it confused the doctor
Whole lotta racks, whole lotta stacks
Fuck a headshot, I'ma shoot him in the back
Three-point-five rolled up in the Cack'
We don't smoke reggie, this shit called gas
I'm sticked up like a blind man
I'm super hot like a frying pan
He say that he gon' take somethin' from me
Ayy, just know, he lyin', man
I'ma up from my hip then blow like a whistle
Your bitch suckin' dick like a Kool-Aid pickle
